## 💡 Tips for Great Posts

### ✅ DO:
- Use clear, simple titles
- Add 2-3 images
- Include key numbers and facts
- Use headings to organize
- Add contact information at the end

### ❌ DON'T:
- Don't write super long posts (500-1000 words is good)
- Don't forget to add images
- Don't use special characters in file names
- Don't forget the date in filename

---

## 📅 File Naming Rules

### Correct Format:
`YYYY-MM-DD-title-with-dashes.md`

### Examples:
✅ `2025-11-20-new-products-launch.md`
✅ `2025-12-01-holiday-collection.md`
✅ `2026-01-15-iso-certification-renewed.md`

### Wrong:
❌ `new products.md` (no date, has space)
❌ `2025-11-20-新产品.md` (Chinese characters)
❌ `my post 2025.md` (wrong format)
