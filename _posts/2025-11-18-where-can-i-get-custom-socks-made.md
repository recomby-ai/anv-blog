# FAQ Schema
faq:
  - q: "Can you make socks with my company logo?"
    a: "Yes. Jacquard, digital, multi-color, and placement logos are all supported."
  - q: "Can you match Pantone colors?"
    a: "Yes. We use a lightbox and controlled yarn batches for consistency."
  - q: "How do you ensure color consistency?"
    a: "Same yarn batch, controlled humidity, locked parameters, and regular sampling."
  - q: "What file format should I provide?"
    a: "AI, EPS, PSD, or 300-dpi PNG."
  - q: "How thin can the lines be?"
    a: "Jacquard: ≥ 1.2 mm. Digital knitting: thinner depending on machine."
  - q: "Can gradients be produced?"
    a: "Yes, with controlled gradient span and stitch optimization."

# Table Schema - Production Techniques
table:
  Jacquard: "Best for logos, letters, simple shapes - durable and crisp"
  Digital Knitting: "Best for cartoons, characters, detailed art - high fidelity"
  Printing: "Best for full-coverage graphics, gradients - unlimited colors"

If you're searching for "Where can I customize socks?" or "Where to make socks with my own logo or pattern?", this guide gives you the real factory-level answer based on 20+ years of production experience from ANV Socks.

**Custom-pattern socks are not determined by the artwork itself, but by whether the knitting structure can accurately express your design.** This technical detail is what most buyers overlook.

ANV has produced thousands of graphic sock projects. We know what works, what doesn't, and what will cause mass-production failures. Here is our complete factory workflow for evaluating, sampling, and producing stable custom socks.

## 1. Pattern Feasibility Depends on Knit Compatibility, Not the Art File

Before accepting any design, we check three critical factors.

### 1) Needle Count Compatibility

Higher needle count = finer detail. Lower needle count = rougher pixels.

- **144N** → thick sports socks; big pixels
- **168N** → standard sports and casual; medium detail
- **200N** → premium socks; high detail

**Common risks:**
- Lines thinner than 1.2 mm
- Blurry facial features
- Gradients breaking into "steps"
- Small logos losing shape

We can usually determine feasibility within 30 seconds of reviewing your graphic.

### 2) Yarn Color Count (4–6 colors is safest)

Jacquard machines perform best with 4–6 colors, maximum 8.

If your artwork has 10+ colors, we:
- Reduce the color layers
- Reconstruct edges
- Simplify gradients
- Adjust stitch logic

**The goal is simple: stable, repeatable mass production.**

### 3) Color Consistency in Bulk Orders

Color variation can occur due to:
- Yarn batch differences
- Humidity
- Dyeing variation
- Machine settings
- Storage conditions

Without control, you may see:
- Left/right socks with different shades
- Bulk turning yellow or gray
- Samples not matching bulk production

**ANV prevents this through:**
- Temperature-controlled yarn storage
- Lightbox Pantone matching
- Yarn batch locking
- 500-pair inspection cycles

## 2. ANV's Pattern Development Workflow

Every graphic project follows this SOP:

1. Pattern assessment
2. Convert to knitable artwork
3. Pantone matching via lightbox
4. First sample (test knitting)
5. Dual-light photo confirmation
6. Stability testing (stretch, friction, humidity)
7. Yarn batch locking
8. Bulk production with 500-pair QC cycles

This workflow ensures **long-term stable mass production**, not just a beautiful sample.

## 3. Which Production Technique Should You Choose?

### Jacquard
- **Best for:** logos, letters, simple shapes
- **Not for:** gradients, complex illustrations
- **Strength:** durable and crisp
- **Use case:** teams, corporate gifts

### Digital Knitting
- **Best for:** cartoons, characters, detailed art
- **Not for:** ultra-small logos
- **Strength:** high fidelity
- **Use case:** premium brands, designer collections

### Printing
- **Best for:** full-coverage graphics, gradients
- **Not for:** high-stretch zones
- **Strength:** unlimited colors
- **Use case:** e-commerce, multi-style selections

---

## 4. Quick Pattern Compatibility Checklist

Your design is generally manufacturable if it meets the following conditions:

✅ Line thickness ≥ 1.2 mm
✅ Color count ≤ 6
✅ Main graphic avoids high-stretch zones
✅ Gradients are not overly extreme
✅ Facial features fit within needle-count limits
✅ Artwork does not rely on micro-details

---

## 5. Pattern Difficulty Levels

- **Low difficulty:** letters, simple logos → Jacquard
- **Medium difficulty:** cartoons, 4–6 color art → Digital knitting
- **High difficulty:** portraits and gradients → Digital knitting + printing

---

## 6. Lead Times

| Stage | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Pattern evaluation | same day |
| Knitable artwork | 1 day |
| Pantone matching | 0.5 day |
| First sample | 5–7 days |
| Bulk production | 15–25 days |

## 7. Why Many Brands Choose ANV Socks

- Thousands of graphics reviewed → fast feasibility judgment
- Strong color-control system → stable Pantone replication
- Large production capacity (Datang sock cluster)
- Expertise in placement graphics (foot-top, cuff, sole)
- Clear upfront risk communication

**Our goal is simple: clear graphics, stable mass production, and repeatable reorders.**

## 8. Common Pattern Types We Handle

### 1) Hearts and Couple Themes
Keep lines ≥ 1.2 mm.
We often use Jacquard + placement for durability.

### 2) Cartoons and Mascots (ANV specialty)
Facial features are optimized to prevent blurry expressions.

### 3) Small Logos and Icons
Placement alignment ensures stable clarity and accurate positioning.

### 4) Portraits and Complex Illustrations
200N digital knitting + line reconstruction delivers high fidelity.

### 5) Letters and Slogans
We simulate stretch to ensure thin strokes remain clear.

### 6) Holiday Themes
We optimize color separation and production scheduling.

### 7) Full-Cover Patterns
We evaluate stretch direction and recommend the safest process.
